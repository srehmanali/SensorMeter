# Sensor Meter
This Project was developed to provide a solution to Rhino, tanker trailer manufacturers, to identify the leakage in the tanker once tanker is built. The tanker is filed with some water and the sensors are kept inside the tanker. The tank sealed and presurised, the sensors sends the serial data of the presure to this web application in a specific format and this application shows the live graph for the pressure in the tanker if the pressure is drop to a certain level the app will notify the user about the leakage.
