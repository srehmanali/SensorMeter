# Sensor Meter
The purpose of this project is to offer a leakage detection solution to Rhino, a manufacturer of tanker trailers. The solution involves filling the tanker with water and inserting sensors into it. The tanker is then sealed and pressurized with air. The sensors send the pressure data in a specific format to a web application, which displays a real-time graph of the pressure within the tanker. If the pressure drops below a specific level, the application sends a notification to the user, indicating that there is a leakage in the tanker. The application also manages the tanker based on its unique ID.
