# Sensor Meter
This Project was developed to provide a solution to Rhino, tanker trailer manufacturers, to identify the leakage in the tanker once tanker is built. The tanker is filed with some water and the sensors are kept inside. The tanker is then sealed and pressurised wit air, the sensors sends the serial data of the presure to this web application in a specific format and application shows the real time graph for the pressure in the tanker if the pressure is drop to a certain level the app will notify the user about the leakage. This app also manages the tanker on basis of tanker unique id.
